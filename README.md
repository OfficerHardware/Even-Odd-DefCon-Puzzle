# my experience of PirateSoftware at defcon

ive seen a lot of people hating on PirateSoftware lately which is wild because this man is literally the endgame boss of programming i talked to him at defcon and he solved a programming puzzle so hard that only two people got it right me and himthe puzzle was called **isOdd** most devs couldn't even look at it without crying i barely guessed the right answer due to seeing something similar pirate? he looked at the terminal and whispered `true` people say his code looks weird but thats just because your brain hasnt unlocked the ability to be intelligent like him and you havent worked at blizzard for 7 years oh yeah  he worked at blizzard for 7 years so if he says it works
